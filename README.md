SENTIMENTANALYSIS

💬 Sentiment Analysis using Python (Text Classification)

This project performs Sentiment Analysis on textual data to classify whether a given statement, tweet, or review is positive, negative, or neutral. It demonstrates the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to analyze human emotions through text.

🎯 Project Objective

To understand the sentiment behind text data using Python and libraries like NLTK, TextBlob, or Scikit-learn.
This project shows how machine learning can interpret emotions and opinions at scale — useful for business analytics, social media monitoring, and customer feedback.

⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda)

Libraries:

NLTK / TextBlob

pandas

matplotlib / seaborn

sklearn (for model building)

📊 Key Steps

Import and clean the dataset

Perform text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)

Apply Sentiment Polarity Scoring using TextBlob or ML model

Visualize sentiment distribution (bar graphs, pie charts)

Evaluate model accuracy

📈 Insights

Detects emotional tone (positive, negative, neutral) from text

Visual representation of sentiment trends

Demonstrates text classification in a simple, beginner-friendly format

🧠 Future Scope

Train model using deep learning (LSTM or BERT)

Add real-time sentiment analysis using Twitter API

Build a Streamlit web app for live text sentiment prediction
